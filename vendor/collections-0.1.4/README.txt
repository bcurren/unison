== Collections

The Ruby Collections gem contains several collection classes. 
The SequencedHash (aka OrderedHash) maintains the insertion order.
The LRUMap discards the least recently used items first. It can be used as a simple caching mechanism.
The Stack represents a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of objects.

== RoadMap
LFUMap and many more collections classes will follow.
