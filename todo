Backlog
--------
* Introduce the ability to project specific attributes
Topic#expose should work for signals with relations as the values
cleanup PrimitiveTuple#[] specs



Icebox
--------

Make it possible to pull AttributeProjections and InnerJoins:
  Rather than implementing #set of every relation that tells Repository where to put the results of pulling that relation's
  SQL query, implement #insert on every relation. Insert will be in charge of taking a given row and multiplexing the data
  contained therein to underlying models. This will require that AttributeProjections and InnerJoins implement #tuple_class,
  so that the repository can instantiate an instance thereof.


Potentially rip out support for referencing hash_representation on unretained Topics... OR
  do transform in PrimitiveField and not the [] reader, which means we need to address the following:
  PrimitiveTuple#attributes calls the transform block on field values. Do we want to do this on persist? If not, add PrimitiveTuple#persistent_attributes
